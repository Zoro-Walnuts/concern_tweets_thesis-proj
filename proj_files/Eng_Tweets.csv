In some cases, they have been beheaded, even raped and mutilated. There are videos showing all these atrociously cruel acts of barbarity.

It has been proven over time that women are more likely to be attracted to men who exhibit Dark Triad traits;

• The Narcissistic • Machiavellian • Courageous • & Psychopathic.

Because those characteristics mimic competence and capabilities.

... For this very reason, they are willing and would be OK marrying a man they had a wild or reckless past with.

But unfortunately, no man wants to marry the woman he lived a wayward life with.

... Because it's believed that whatever you teach a woman; she'll do it better than you and become uncontrollable.

This and many more are reasons why I tell women to protect & highly safeguard their interests & values. 

... And know that whatever they place value on, whether money or material things... Men are willing to pay until they're used, rewashed, and overused.

The standards, the baggage, men are responsible for it, yet will still judge and dump you for it, and go for the one they perceive as better.

@seratoninxvt,what’s frustrating about having a personality disorder or a mental illness is that you don’t know what’s good for you or what you need. you’re just doing the best you can to get by. your brain controls your behaviour and it’s ill. it’s disordered. it’s like your compass in life is cracked. so you’re looking around at other people who know which direction to go and wondering “why can’t i be like them? why is it so hard for me?” but you have to remember that they have a functioning compass and you don’t. you’re going to need extra help to stay on the right path and that’s okay.,9/12/24,0
